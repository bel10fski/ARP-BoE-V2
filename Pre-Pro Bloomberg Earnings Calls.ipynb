Each transcript contains two main sections: MD (Management Discussion) / Presentation and QA (Questions and Answers). The consistent format of these transcripts, downloaded from Bloomberg, makes them ideal for processing."

The script reads the text files, extracts relevant details, applies cleaning transformations, and then saves the cleaned text to a new directory. Additionally, it uses pre-extracted lists of participants to enhance the cleaning process."
